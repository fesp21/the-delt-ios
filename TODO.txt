* BUGS *
********
	
	- Profile photo upload causes exception 'This query has an outstanding network connection. You have to wait until it's done.' May only be when you try and quit the app:
		Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'This query has an outstanding network connection. You have to wait until it's done.'
