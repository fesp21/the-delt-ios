* BUGS *
********
	
	- Profile photo upload causes exception 'This query has an outstanding network connection. You have to wait until it's done.' May only be when you try and quit the app.

		Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'This query has an outstanding network connection. You have to wait until it's done.'
